# STA304_Ref6 Project

This project is part of the STA304 course, focusing on data analysis and reporting using SQL, Quarto and R. We use SQL in order to perform the data cleaning and filtering. Using Quarto and R, we perform the code of analysis and graphing. It includes various analyses, visualizations, and discussions based on data from the [Hammer Dataset](https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/).

## Project Structure

- `paper/`: Contains the `.qmd` files for analysis, a pdf that contains the report, and a reference list.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- `SQL/`: contains SQL code for data cleaning.
- `LLM`: Contains LLM usage
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: SQL scripts in the SQL/ folder transform raw data into clean, analysis-ready datasets.
- Statistical Analysis: Conducted in R, covering descriptive and inferential methods.
- Visualizations: High-quality plots and graphs to support discussions.
- Automation: Integration of SQL and Quarto for a seamless workflow.
- LLM Usage: Explores how language models assist in coding and data analysis.
  
- ## LLM statement
- LLM is used to find the way to push R works to github.
