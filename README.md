# STA304_Ref6 Project

This repository contains the work for the STA304 course, focusing on data analysis and reporting using SQL, Quarto, and R. The project involves cleaning and filtering data using SQL, performing analysis and visualization in R, and compiling results into a report using Quarto.

The data for this project comes from the Hammer Dataset, and the analyses aim to uncover meaningful insights through statistical techniques, visualizations, and discussions.

## About the dataset
The Hammer Dataset used in this project provides a rich source for analysis, enabling exploration of various statistical methods and their applications. Learn more about the dataset from [Hammer Dataset](https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/).

## Project Structure

- `paper/`: Contains the `.qmd` files for analysis, a pdf that contains the report, and a reference list.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- `SQL/`: contains SQL code for data cleaning.
- `LLM`: Contains LLM usage
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: SQL scripts in the SQL/ folder transform raw data into clean, analysis-ready datasets.
- Statistical Analysis: Conducted in R, covering descriptive and inferential methods.
- Visualizations: High-quality plots and graphs to support discussions.
- Automation: Integration of SQL and Quarto for a seamless workflow.
- LLM Usage: Explores how language models assist in coding and data analysis.
  
- ## LLM statement
Language Learning Models (LLMs) were used in the following capacities:
- Automating repetitive R tasks.
- Troubleshooting code issues.
- Finding efficient methods to push R projects to GitHub.
